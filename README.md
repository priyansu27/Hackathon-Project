Smart Postal System - Address & Pin Code Verification
This project aims to develop an AI-powered postal system that helps users verify addresses and pin codes, ensuring accurate deliveries.

Work in Progress: While the project is still under development, we're actively working on completing the machine learning (ML) part, which will enhance the accuracy of address suggestions and verifications. Stay tuned! We're committed to delivering a fully functional version very soon.

Feel free to explore the current frontend, and watch this repository for updates as we continue to improve and finalize the ML integration!
